- 👋 Hi, I’m @shoppingfever
- 👀 I’m interested in ...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html and CSS and i love it. Not to be web designer or something like that, but i have to learn something that is    completly different to my day to day basis.
  At the Age of 53 that is not easy.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on lots of things, but what really is close to my heart is the big problem with homelessness and affordable living in Canada. If we all pitch in (not money) we will have something in return that you cant buy with money! Kindness.
Checkout woodhaus.ca in the near future
Spread the word.
And show the BIG CORPORATIONS that there is a way to participate in the climate change REVOLUTION!
  I have a building system which we would be able to build houses in 3 month, turnkey operation. No glue or chemicals used. 
  What does that have to do with software?
  You would be ammazed what other contries are doing and we here in North America are a third world, SASS at its finest
